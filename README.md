# Hyperion - App Inspection Tool

## What is it?

Hyperion is a hidden plugin drawer that can easily be integrated into any app. The drawer sits discreetly ðŸ™Š under the app so that it is there when you need it and out of the way when you don't. Hyperion plugins are designed to make inspection of your app quick and simple.

## Third-Party Plugins
Calling all developers!!! Be one of the first to create a third-party plugin. The plugin creation guide is a work in progress, but if you are feeling ambitious you can reference the plugins we have already created.

To create your own plugin, implement the Plugin interface and expose the implementation as a service. The plugins made available in this repository leverage Google's [AutoService][1] annotation processor to generate the service metadata and simplify the process.

## How To Show Hyperion Plugin List
Once Hyperion is integrated into your app, simply shake your phone to activate. If you are running your app on an emulator, you can manually open the menu by calling `Hyperion.open(Activity activity)`. You can also open the menu by selecting the foreground notification that appears while the client app is in the foreground.

By default, Hyperion automatically finds every plugin that is available in the project using the Java Service Locator.
